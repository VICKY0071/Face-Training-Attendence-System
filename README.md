# Face-Training-Attendence-System

This program is base on the open cv and is basically used to check and take the attendance of a student based on his face which will be trained 
once and than will be added to the database 
Right now the files are going to a csv file bu soon ill update the code where the information about the students attendance and details 
of thje student will go to a database , this might be much more organised..
Also this program needs you to have just tkinter and ope-ncv and version of opencv will work because I am using the methods which 
are not changed in any versions of open-cv 
allthough requirements.txt file has been provided so just try and install that before running the program
